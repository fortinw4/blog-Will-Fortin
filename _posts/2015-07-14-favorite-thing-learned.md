# My Favorite Lesson from Rockit Bootcamp thus far

I had a wonderful time learning how to create media objects,
which affectionately became known as 'meaty objects'.

It was an awesome experience to learn the proper way to put things 
side by side in CSS.

It made sense learning how to use the clearfix / float  / margin strategy.
